 ## Q1 What were the training and test set accuracies when you used 1 neuron in the neural network, and when you used 100 neurons in the neural network?  What is your best explanation for these outcomes?

1. Taking TextClassifier Notebook as an example, the default neuron value is 10, and the accuracy of the test set and training set is shown in the following figure:

When the value of neuron is 1 and 100, the accuracy of the test set and training set are shown in the following figures:
